ETL Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Project Objective:
------------------
The objective of this project is to design and implement a cloud-native ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for employee data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The project demonstrates:

Efficient data ingestion, transformation, and storage.

Generation of actionable insights through visualization dashboards.

A real-world approach to building data engineering pipelines without requiring machine learning models.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Phases:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1: Data Generation & Ingestion
----
Synthetic employee data is generated with attributes like name, email, job title, and joining date.

Raw data is stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Phase 2: Data Transformation
----
Cloud Data Fusion is used to clean and transform the data.

Sensitive information (e.g., personal identifiers) is masked.

Data is validated for consistency before loading.

Phase 3: Data Loading
---
Cleaned and transformed data is loaded into BigQuery.

BigQuery tables are designed to support fast querying and analytics.

Phase 4: Data Visualization
---
Looker Studio dashboards visualize key metrics:

Employee distribution by department.

Tenure and join date trends.

Other HR insights.

Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------
The ETL pipeline is divided into four main layers:

1. Data Generation & Ingestion Layer

Purpose: Generate and ingest raw employee data.

Components:

Python + Faker Library: Generates synthetic employee data.

Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Stores raw CSV/JSON files as a landing zone.

2. ETL / Transformation Layer

Purpose: Clean, transform, and prepare data for analytics.

Components:

Cloud Data Fusion: No-code ETL tool that reads data from GCS, applies transformations, validates schema, and masks sensitive data.

3. Data Storage & Analytics Layer

Purpose: Store processed data and enable analytics queries.

Components:

BigQuery: Centralized analytics warehouse.

Partitioned tables and optimized schema for fast querying.

4. Visualization Layer

Purpose: Provide insights through interactive dashboards.

Components:

Looker Studio: Connects to BigQuery and visualizes employee metrics (department-wise distribution, tenure trends, etc.).

Components to illustrate:
----------------------------------------------------------
Data Generation → GCS → Cloud Data Fusion → BigQuery → Looker Studio

Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates a complete ETL workflow in the cloud:

Handles raw data ingestion, transformation, and storage.

Enables easy analytics with BigQuery.

Provides interactive dashboards in Looker Studio for business insights.

Serves as a strong portfolio project for data engineering and analytics roles.

If you want, I can also make a polished Markdown version with GitHub badges, TOC, and ready-to-use headings so it looks professional on your repository.
