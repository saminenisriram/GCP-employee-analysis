ETL Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform

This project demonstrates the creation of a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The pipeline extracts employee data, transforms it, loads it into BigQuery, and visualizes the results using Looker Studio.

🧩 Architecture Overview

The pipeline comprises the following components:

Data Extraction

Synthetic employee data is generated, including details like names, emails, job titles, and other attributes.

Data is stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as raw files.

Data Transformation & Loading

Cloud Data Fusion is used to read data from GCS, perform transformations such as masking sensitive information, and load clean data into BigQuery for analytics.

Data Visualization

Looker Studio dashboards are created to visualize key metrics, such as employee distribution across departments, tenure, and other insights.

🚀 Project Highlights

Fully cloud-native ETL pipeline using GCP services.

Handles both raw data ingestion and data transformation.

Data is stored and managed efficiently in BigQuery, enabling fast queries.

Provides interactive dashboards for easy data visualization and analysis.

Designed to demonstrate real-world ETL workflows without requiring complex machine learning models.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) – Raw data storage

Cloud Data Fusion – ETL processing

BigQuery – Data warehousing and analytics
